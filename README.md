# An Example REST API in Go using the Gin framemwork
This API allows CRUD operations to a "Magic 8-Ball" fortune database. Basically, you can create a bunch of fortunes, then hit the `GET` endpoint to receive a random fortune.

## What is this for?
I made this example API to use as part of a series of blog posts outlining some different API related topics:
 - The Gin framework
 - Swagger/OpenAPI Codegen
 - Setting up a Go dev environment with Vagrant
 and some other topics in the near future
